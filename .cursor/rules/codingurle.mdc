Always remember do it very precised, coding like a senior dev, really make a plan first and itterate on it, that you are very sure, and divide all steps in the smallest and clearest steps possible

save me a MD file where you explain what you did and why, save this plan in a MD always and  then START Coding

write very less code, less code is better, only what is necessary, and after implementing the small steps always test them
