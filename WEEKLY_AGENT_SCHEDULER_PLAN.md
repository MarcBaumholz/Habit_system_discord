## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Manual Trigger
Create command to trigger immediate report:

- [ ] All 5 agents execute successfully
- [ ] Report generated within 60 seconds
- [ ] Discord messages sent correctly
- [ ] Data stored in Notion
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully

## üöÄ Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Do First)
1. Create WeeklyAgentScheduler class
2. Update agent channel restrictions
3. Enhance agent prompts
4. Test individual agent triggers

### Medium Priority (Do Second)
5. Create scheduler with cron
6. Build response aggregator
7. Implement Discord formatting

### Low Priority (Polish)
8. Add historical tracking
9. Create manual trigger command
10. Build feedback mechanism

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Start with Phase 2: Expand agent prompts
2. Create WeeklyAgentScheduler class
3. Test each agent individually
4. Integrate scheduler into bot
5. Deploy and monitor first execution

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours for full implementation and testing
