**What It Is**: Guide the model to articulate reasoning steps before answering

**How to Apply**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (Weak)
const prompt = `Analyze the user's habits and provide recommendations.`;

// ‚úÖ AFTER (Strong)
const prompt = `Analyze the user's habits using the following steps:

STEP 1: Identify patterns in completion data
STEP 2: Assess consistency and motivation trends
STEP 3: Compare with successful habit formation research
STEP 4: Generate personalized recommendations based on patterns
STEP 5: Provide reasoning for each recommendation

Please explain your reasoning at each step before providing the final recommendations.`;
```

**Benefits**: 
- Improves accuracy by 30-50% on complex tasks
- Makes AI reasoning transparent and debuggable
- Reduces hallucinations

```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE (Weak)
const prompt = `Respond in JSON format with: personalityScore, habitAlignmentScore...`;

// ‚úÖ AFTER (Strong)
const prompt = `
Analyze the user's identity alignment and respond with EXACTLY this JSON structure:

{
  "personalityScore": <number 1-10>,
  "habitAlignmentScore": <number 1-10>,
  "identityEvolutionStage": <string: "Forming" | "Developing" | "Established" | "Mastered">,
  "recommendedHabits": [
    {
      "habit": "<specific habit name>",
      "alignmentReason": "<why it matches personality>",
      "implementation": "<concrete steps to start>",
      "expectedImpact": "<predicted identity impact>"
    }
  ],
  "identityInsights": "<2-3 sentences of key insights>",
  "confidenceLevel": <number 0-1>,
  "reasoningSteps": [
    "<step 1 explanation>",
    "<step 2 explanation>"
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text before or after.
`;
```

**Benefits**:
- Ensures consistent parsing
- Reduces errors from malformed responses

const prompt = `
Analyze habit patterns and provide insights.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: User completed habit 5/7 days, mostly mornings, low energy on missed days
Output: {
  "pattern": "Morning habits succeed, energy-dependent",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "recommendation": "Schedule habits before 10 AM when energy is highest"
}

EXAMPLE 2:
Input: User completed habit 2/7 days, inconsistent timing, many distractions
Output: {
  "pattern": "Lack of routine and environment control",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "recommendation": "Create implementation intention: 'After coffee, I will do X in quiet room'"
}

NOW ANALYZE THIS USER:
${userContext}
`;
```

- Vague "identity insights"
- No reasoning transparency

**Improved Prompt**:
```typescript
const prompt = `
ROLE: Expert in identity-based habit formation (James Clear methodology)

ANALYSIS TASK: Evaluate identity-habit alignment

USER PROFILE:
- Personality: ${userProfile.personalityType}
- Values: ${userProfile.coreValues}
- Desired Identity: ${userProfile.desiredIdentity}
- Current Habits: ${habits}

REASONING PROCESS:
STEP 1 - Personality Analysis:
Analyze how ${personalityType} individuals typically form habits. Consider:
- Natural tendencies and strengths
- Common struggle areas
- Optimal habit structures

STEP 2 - Value Alignment Check:
Compare each current habit against core values:
${coreValues.map(v => `- Does habit align with "${v}"? Why/why not?`)}

STEP 3 - Identity Gap Analysis:
Current identity signals vs. Desired identity (${desiredIdentity}):
- What habits support desired identity?
- What habits conflict with it?
- What's missing?

STEP 4 - Scoring:
- Personality Score (1-10): Rate habit-personality fit
- Alignment Score (1-10): Rate value-habit alignment
- Confidence (0-1): How certain are you?

STEP 5 - Recommendations:
Generate 3 specific habits that would strengthen ${desiredIdentity}

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON):
{
  "personalityScore": <number>,
  "habitAlignmentScore": <number>,
  "identityEvolutionStage": "<Forming|Developing|Established|Mastered>",
  "recommendedHabits": [
    {
      "habit": "<specific, measurable habit>",
      "identityConnection": "<how it reinforces ${desiredIdentity}>",
      "implementationPlan": "<when, where, how to start>",
      "expectedImpact": "<specific outcome in 30 days>",
      "personalityFit": "<why this works for ${personalityType}>"
    }
  ],
  "identityInsights": "<2-3 key insights>",
  "reasoning": {
    "personalityAnalysis": "<step 1 findings>",
    "alignmentAnalysis": "<step 2 findings>",
    "gapAnalysis": "<step 3 findings>"

Evaluate: ${proofs}
Consider:
- Day-to-day variability
- Time of day patterns
- Minimal vs full dose ratio
Score: ___
Evidence: ___

STEP 2 - Motivation Assessment (1-10):
Indicators from data:

IF consistencyScore < 3 OR motivationLevel < 3:
  Type = "intervention" (urgent support)
ELSE IF streak >= 5 AND consistencyScore >= 8:
  Type = "celebration" (positive reinforcement)
ELSE IF patterns show decline:
  Type = "check-in" (gentle nudge)
ELSE:
  Type = "encouragement" (maintain momentum)

STEP 5 - Message Generation:
Create message that:
1. References specific data (e.g., "I noticed you completed 5/7 days...")
2. Acknowledges effort ("Your minimal dose on Tuesday showed commitment...")
3. Addresses root cause ("Evening habits seem challenging...")
4. Provides ONE specific action ("Try moving habit to morning this week...")
5. Ends with encouragement

OUTPUT (STRICT JSON):
{
  "consistencyScore": <1-10>,
  "motivationLevel": <1-10>,
  "riskFactors": [
    {
