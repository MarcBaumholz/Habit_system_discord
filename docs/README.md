# Discord Habit System — Product Overview

> Keep it simple, single-responsibility, test-driven.

## Purpose
Create a trust-based accountability system for 66-day habit journeys inside Discord, backed by Notion for structured data and review workflows.

## Core Concepts
- Groups with clear rules and cadence (kickoff, mid, end calls)
- Daily "proof" submissions (image/video/audio + measure + optional note)
- Minimal dose + planned cheat day
- Social accountability via reactions and "Trust" acknowledgements
- Notion-backed reflections, Keystone Habits, weekly templates

## Key Modules
- Discord Bot (commands, automation, reminders)
- Notion Integration (databases for users, habits, proofs, reflections, weeks)
- 66-Day Challenge Framework (week views, summaries)
- Learnings Feed and Profile Snapshots
- Metrics & Analytics

## User Journeys
- Join challenge → define keystone habits → daily proofs → weekly review → group summaries → learnings
