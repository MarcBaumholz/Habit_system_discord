# Product Vision: Trust-Based Accountability & Learning Network

## Philosophy
- Accountability as the biggest movement: visible, social, confronting commitments
- Trust over follows: credibility emerges when 5+ people trust you
- Quality over quantity in small committed groups

## What Success Looks Like
- Clear weekly progress, low friction daily proofing
- Explicit learnings shared and searchable
- People enjoy process; habits become easier over time

## Scope
- Phase 1: Discord-first experience with Notion backbone
- Phase 2: Rich learnings, card-deck visual progress, profile snapshots
- Phase 3: Full web app while keeping Discord as primary surface
