# Security & Privacy

- Store secrets in `.env` only; never commit tokens
- Rotate tokens regularly; restrict bot permissions to least privilege
- Validate and sanitize all user-provided text
- Respect privacy: proofs default to group visibility; personal channels for sensitive content
- Logging: redact tokens/PII; retention policy 30 days for operational logs
