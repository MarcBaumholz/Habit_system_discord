### 🔧 Features Implemented & Validated

#### 1. ✅ Weekly Frequency Count Fix
**Problem**: Proofs showed "This Week: 0/5" instead of "1/5"
**Solution**: Fixed timing issue - weekly count now calculated AFTER proof creation
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Verified in tests and logs

#### 2. ✅ Comprehensive Database Logging
**Problem**: Database operations were not being logged
**Solution**: Added logging for all database operations:
- Proof creation (automatic & manual)
- User creation
- Keystone habit creation
- Learning creation
- Summary command success/failure
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - All operations now generate structured logs

#### 3. ✅ Server Restart Cleanup
**Problem**: Welcome messages sent after every server restart
**Solution**: 
- Removed startup welcome messages from main channels
- Server restart now only shows in logs channel
- Daily messages only sent at 7 AM, not on startup
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Clean startup without spam

#### 4. ✅ Error Logging Enhancement
**Problem**: Summary command errors not properly logged
**Solution**: Added detailed error logging with stack traces
**Status**: ✅ **WORKING** - Errors now properly captured and logged
