## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Daily Messages Not Working

**Problem:** Daily messages were not appearing in Discord channel `1420295931689173002`

**Root Cause:** Environment variable was set correctly in `.env` file, but the issue was that the bot needed to be restarted to pick up the configuration.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Verified `DISCORD_ACCOUNTABILITY_GROUP=1420295931689173002` was set in `.env`
- ✅ Restarted the bot with `pm2 restart habit-discord-bot`
- ✅ Tested daily message functionality with manual trigger
- ✅ Confirmed messages are now being sent successfully

**Test Results:**
```
✅ Test message sent for day 6/66
📊 Found 6 users in database
✅ Channel found: accountability-group-1 (1420295931689173002)
✅ Bot has permission to send messages
```

### Issue 2: Weekly Summaries Not Working

**Problem:** AI incentive manager was using a placeholder `getAllUsers()` method that returned empty array

**Root Cause:** The `AIIncentiveManager` had its own broken `getAllUsers()` method instead of using the working one from `NotionClient`

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Fixed getAllUsers() method:**
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE (broken):
   private async getAllUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
     console.log('⚠️ getAllUsers method needs to be implemented in NotionClient');
     return []; // Always returned empty array
   }

   // AFTER (fixed):
   private async getAllUsers(): Promise<User[]> {
     console.log('🔍 Fetching all users from Notion for AI incentive analysis...');
     const users = await this.notion.getAllUsers();
     console.log(`📊 Found ${users.length} users for AI analysis`);
     return users;
   }
   ```

2. **Fixed Discord message length limit:**
   - Added message length check (Discord limit: 2000 characters)
   - Reduced AI feedback prompt from 200 to 100 words
   - Added automatic truncation if message exceeds 1900 characters

**Test Results:**
```
📊 Found 6 users in database
✅ Personal channel found: personal-klumpenklarmarc
✅ Bot has permission to send messages to personal channel
✅ AI incentive sent to user Unknown User
✅ Weekly AI incentive analysis completed
```
