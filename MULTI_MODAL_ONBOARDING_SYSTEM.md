# 🎯 **Multi-Modal Onboarding System - Complete Implementation**

## ✅ **What's Been Implemented:**

### **🎯 Two-Modal Onboarding Flow:**

#### **Modal 1: Essential Fields**
- **Personality Type** → "Personality T..." (Select)
- **Core Values** → "Core Values" (Multi-select)
- **Life Vision** → "Life Vision" (Rich text)

#### **Modal 2: Additional Details**
- **Life Domains** → "Life domains" (Multi-select)
- **Life Phase** → "Life Phase" (Select)
- **Desired Identity** → "Desired Identity" (Rich text)
- **Open Space** → "Open Space" (Rich text)

#### **Auto-Filled by System:**

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

### **Step 1: User runs `/onboard`**
- System checks if user exists in Users DB ✅
- System checks if profile already exists ✅
- Shows first modal with essential fields

### **Step 2: User submits first modal**
- System shows second modal with additional details
- User fills out remaining fields

### **Step 3: User submits second modal**
- System creates complete profile in Notion
- All 12 database columns are populated
- Success message shown to user

## 📊 **Database Coverage:**

### **✅ Complete Coverage (12/12 fields):**
1. **Discord ID** - Auto-filled
2. **User** - Auto-filled
