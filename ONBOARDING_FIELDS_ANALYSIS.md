# 📊 **Onboarding Fields Analysis - Complete Database Mapping**

## 🎯 **Current vs Required Fields:**

### **✅ Currently Collected (Modal 1):**
1. **Personality Type** → "Personality T..." (Select)
2. **Core Values** → "Core Values" (Multi-select)
3. **Life Vision** → "Life Vision" (Rich text)
4. **Main Goals** → "Main Goals" (Rich text)
5. **Big Five Traits** → "Big five traits" (Rich text)

### **❌ Missing Fields (Not in Modal):**
6. **Life Domains** → "Life domains" (Multi-select)
7. **Life Phase** → "Life Phase" (Select)
8. **Desired Identity** → "Desired Identity" (Rich text)
9. **Open Space** → "Open Space" (Rich text)

### **✅ Auto-Filled by System:**
- **Discord ID** → "Discord ID" (Title) - from interaction.user.id
- **User** → "User" (Relation) - from Users database
- **Join Date** → "Join Date" (Date) - from current date

## 🔧 **Solution Options:**

### **Option 1: Multi-Modal Approach**
Create a second modal that appears after the first one is submitted.

### **Option 2: Extended Single Modal**
Replace current modal with a more comprehensive one, making some fields optional.

### **Option 3: Profile Edit Command**
Keep current modal minimal and let users complete their profile later with `/profile-edit`.

## 📋 **Recommended Approach:**

**Option 1: Multi-Modal Approach** - This provides the best user experience:

1. **First Modal**: Essential fields (current 5)
2. **Second Modal**: Additional details (4 missing fields)
3. **Auto-fill**: System fields (Discord ID, User, Join Date)

This way users don't get overwhelmed with too many fields at once, but we still capture all the database properties.

## 🎯 **Implementation Plan:**

1. **Keep current modal** for essential fields
2. **Add second modal** triggered after first submission
3. **Update modal submission handler** to show second modal
4. **Update profile creation** to include all fields from both modals
5. **Test complete flow**
