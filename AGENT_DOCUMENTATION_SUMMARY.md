# 🤖 Agent Documentation - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Goal

**Create comprehensive, production-ready documentation for the multi-agent system that clearly defines each agent's role, database interactions, triggers, and implementation guidance for behavior change.**

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Deep Codebase Analysis

**Analyzed:**
- ✅ Orchestrator implementation (`src/agents/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`)
- ✅ All 5 agent implementations (Mentor, Identity, Accountability, Group, Learning)
- ✅ Weekly scheduler system (`src/bot/weekly-agent-scheduler.ts`)
- ✅ Notion client for database patterns (`src/notion/client.ts`)
- ✅ Existing agent specs in `docs/` folder
- ✅ Multi-agent usage guide
- ✅ Previous agent implementation documentation

**Understanding gained:**
- Agent specialization and capabilities
- Request routing and coordination patterns
- Database access patterns (read/write permissions)
- Trigger system (automatic, manual, event-based)
- AI prompt structures using Perplexity
- Behavior change principles implemented
