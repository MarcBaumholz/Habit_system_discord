## 📋 What's Missing / What Needs Configuration

### 🔴 **Critical: Required Before First Run**

#### 1. **Environment Variables**
Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Marc's Channel Configuration
MARC_DISCORD_CHANNEL=1422681618304471131
MARC_DISCORD_USER_ID=<marc-notion-user-id-here>

# Timezone (already exists)
TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
```

**How to get Marc's User ID:**
```bash
# Run this to find Marc's Notion user ID
npx ts-node -e "
import { NotionClient } from './src/notion/client';
const notion = new NotionClient(process.env.NOTION_TOKEN!, {...});
notion.getAllUsers().then(users => {
  users.forEach(u => console.log(u.name, u.id));
});
"
```

#### 2. **Marc's Notion User Profile**
**Required Data in Notion:**
- User record with Discord ID
- Personality profile (for Identity Agent)
- Core values (for Identity Agent)
- Life vision (for Identity Agent)
- At least one active habit
- Recent proofs (for meaningful analysis)

**If Missing:**
- Identity Agent will request profile completion
- Other agents will work with available data
- No system crash, graceful degradation

---

### 🟡 **Important: Recommended Enhancements**

#### 1. **Historical Data for Comparison**
**Currently Missing:**
- Week-over-week comparison
- Trend analysis across multiple weeks
- Personal records tracking

**How to Add:**
After first run, the system will naturally build history. For immediate comparison, manually create a "Weeks" database entry for last week.

#### 2. **Feedback Mechanism**
**Currently Missing:**
- Marc can't rate the analysis
- No feedback loop to improve prompts

**Recommended:**
Add reaction buttons to the report:
- 👍 = Helpful
- 👎 = Not helpful
- ⭐ = Excellent insight

This data can be used to tune agent prompts.

#### 3. **Report Storage**
**Currently Missing:**
- Reports aren't stored in Notion
- Can't review past weekly reports

**Recommended:**
Create a new Notion database:
- **Weekly Reports Database**
  - User (Relation)
  - Week Number (Number)
  - Report Date (Date)
  - Mentor Analysis (Rich Text)
  - Identity Analysis (Rich Text)
  - Accountability Analysis (Rich Text)
  - Learning Analysis (Rich Text)
  - Group Analysis (Rich Text)
  - Overall Score (Number)

---

### 🟢 **Nice to Have: Future Enhancements**

#### 1. **Manual Trigger Command**
Add Discord slash command:
```
/weekly-report [test]  # Trigger report immediately
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
new SlashCommandBuilder()
  .setName('weekly-report')
  .setDescription('Generate weekly agent analysis now')
  .addBooleanOption(option =>
    option.setName('test')
      .setDescription('Send as test message')
      .setRequired(false))
```

#### 2. **Per-Agent Commands**
Trigger individual agents:
```
/mentor-check    # Just mentor agent
/identity-check  # Just identity agent
/accountability  # Just accountability agent
/learning-check  # Just learning agent
/group-check     # Just group agent
```

#### 3. **Configurable Schedule**
Allow Marc to change schedule via command:
```
/set-schedule [day] [time]
```

#### 4. **Agent Weights**
Let Marc configure which agents are most important:
```
/agent-config
  - Mentor: High priority
  - Identity: Medium priority
  - Accountability: High priority
  - Learning: Low priority
  - Group: Medium priority
```

#### 5. **Summary Email**
Send report via email as backup:
- PDF format
- Charts and visualizations
- Downloadable for review

#### 6. **Mobile Notifications**
Push notifications when report is ready:
- Discord mobile notification
- Optional SMS
- Optional email

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Update Environment Variables**

```bash
# Edit your .env file
nano /home/pi/Documents/habit_System/Habit_system_discord/.env

# Add these lines:
MARC_DISCORD_CHANNEL=1422681618304471131
MARC_DISCORD_USER_ID=<get-from-notion>
```

### **Step 2: Get Marc's Notion User ID**

```bash
cd /home/pi/Documents/habit_System/Habit_system_discord

# Quick script to find user ID
node -e "
require('dotenv').config();
const { NotionClient } = require('./dist/notion/client');
const notion = new NotionClient(process.env.NOTION_TOKEN, {
  users: process.env.NOTION_DATABASE_USERS,
  // ... other databases
});
notion.getAllUsers().then(users => {
  users.forEach(u => console.log(\`\${u.name}: \${u.id}\`));
});
"
```

### **Step 3: Build the Project**

```bash
npm run build
```

### **Step 4: Test the Scheduler**

```bash
# Test without waiting for Wednesday
npx ts-node test-weekly-agents.ts
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Starting Weekly Agent Test...
✅ Discord client ready
🤖 Initializing agents...
✅ All agents initialized successfully
🚀 Starting weekly analysis...
🧘‍♂️ Running Mentor Agent...
🆔 Running Identity Agent...
📊 Running Accountability Agent...
📚 Running Learning Agent...
👥 Running Group Agent...
✅ Weekly analysis complete!
```

### **Step 5: Check Discord**

Go to Marc's channel (1422681618304471131) and verify:
- ✅ Report header appeared
- ✅ All 5 agent analyses are present
- ✅ Messages are properly formatted
- ✅ No errors in console

### **Step 6: Deploy to Production**

```bash
# If using Docker
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:restart

# If using PM2
npm run build
pm2 restart discord-habit-bot

# Check logs
pm2 logs discord-habit-bot
```

### **Step 7: Verify Scheduler**

```bash
# Check scheduler status in logs
pm2 logs discord-habit-bot | grep "Weekly"

# Should see:
# "📅 Weekly agent scheduler started (Wednesday 9 AM, timezone: Europe/Berlin)"
# "🎯 Target channel: 1422681618304471131"
```

### **Step 8: Wait for Wednesday 9am** ⏰

Or manually trigger test:
```bash
npx ts-node test-weekly-agents.ts
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "User not found for Discord ID"**

**Cause:** `MARC_DISCORD_USER_ID` not set or incorrect

**Solution:**
1. Get correct user ID from Notion
2. Update .env file
3. Restart bot

### **Issue: "Target channel not found"**

**Cause:** Bot doesn't have access to channel 1422681618304471131

**Solution:**
1. Verify channel ID is correct
2. Ensure bot has permissions in that channel
3. Bot needs "View Channel" and "Send Messages" permissions

### **Issue: "Perplexity API key not available"**

**Cause:** Missing or invalid API key

**Solution:**
1. Verify `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` in .env
2. Check API key is active at perplexity.ai
3. Ensure no quotes around the key

### **Issue: "Agent initialization failed"**

**Cause:** One or more agents couldn't initialize

**Solution:**
1. Check logs for specific agent error
2. Verify Notion databases are accessible
3. Verify Perplexity API is working
4. Check network connectivity

### **Issue: "Message too long"**

**Cause:** Agent response exceeds Discord's 2000 char limit

**Solution:**
- Already handled! The scheduler automatically splits messages
- If issue persists, reduce prompt verbosity in agent files

### **Issue: "Scheduler didn't run on Wednesday"**

**Cause:** Cron not triggering or bot was offline

**Solution:**
1. Check bot was running at 9am Wednesday
2. Verify timezone is correct (`TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin`)
3. Check PM2/Docker logs for cron trigger message
4. Manually test with `npx ts-node test-weekly-agents.ts`
