# Quick script to find user ID
cd /home/pi/Documents/habit_System/Habit_system_discord
node -e "
require('dotenv').config();
const { Client } = require('@notionhq/client');
const notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN });
notion.databases.query({ database_id: process.env.NOTION_DATABASE_USERS })
  .then(r => r.results.forEach(p => 
    console.log(\`Discord ID: \${p.properties['DiscordID']?.title?.[0]?.plain_text} - User ID: \${p.id}\`)
  ));
"

## 📋 What's Missing / Configuration Needed

### 🔴 Critical (Required Before First Run)

#### 1. Environment Variables
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs Configuration

Add to `.env`:
```bash
MARC_DISCORD_USER_ID=<get-from-notion>
```

**How to Get:**
Run the script in Step 2 above to find Marc's Notion user ID.

#### 2. Marc's Notion Data
**Status:** ℹ️ Should Exist (verify)

**Required:**
- ✅ User record in Notion Users DB
- ✅ Discord ID matches environment variable
- ✅ At least one habit
- ⚠️ Personality profile (optional, for Identity Agent)
- ⚠️ Recent proofs (for meaningful analysis)

**If Missing:**
- Agents will work with available data
- Identity Agent will request profile completion if missing
- Other agents provide analysis based on what's available

---

### 🟡 Recommended Enhancements

#### 1. Historical Tracking
**Status:** 📝 Future Enhancement

**What's Missing:**
- Week-over-week comparison
- Trend analysis across multiple weeks
- Personal records tracking

**Solution:**
After first run, system will naturally build history. For immediate comparison, create a manual "Weeks" database entry for last week.

#### 2. Feedback Mechanism
**Status:** 📝 Future Enhancement

**What's Missing:**
- Marc can't rate the analysis quality
- No feedback loop to improve prompts

**Recommended:**
Add reaction buttons to reports:
- 👍 = Helpful
- 👎 = Not helpful
- ⭐ = Excellent insight
- 💡 = New idea

#### 3. Report Storage in Notion
**Status:** 📝 Future Enhancement

**What's Missing:**
- Reports aren't stored in Notion
- Can't review past weekly reports

**Recommended:**
Create new database: **Weekly Reports**
- User (Relation)
- Week Number (Number)
- Report Date (Date)
- Agent Analyses (Rich Text fields)
- Overall Score (Number)

#### 4. Manual Trigger Command
**Status:** 📝 Future Enhancement

Add slash command:
```typescript
/weekly-report [test]  // Trigger report now
```

#### 5. Per-Agent Commands
**Status:** 📝 Future Enhancement

Trigger individual agents:
```
/mentor-check       // Just mentor agent
/identity-check     // Just identity agent
/accountability     // Just accountability agent
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User not found for Discord ID"
**Solution:** Set `MARC_DISCORD_USER_ID` in .env (see Step 2)
