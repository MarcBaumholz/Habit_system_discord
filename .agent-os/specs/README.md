# Specs - What to Build Next

This folder contains detailed feature specifications for upcoming development work.

## Spec Structure

Each spec should follow this structure:

1. **Overview**: What is being built and why
2. **Requirements**: Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **Technical Specification**: Implementation details
4. **Task Breakdown**: Organized by specialty (database, backend, frontend, testing)
5. **Verification**: How to verify the implementation

## Creating a New Spec

1. Use the `shape-spec` workflow to research and gather requirements
2. Write the spec document using the template
3. Break down into tasks using `create-tasks`
4. Implement using `implement-tasks`
5. Verify using the verification criteria
