## 🔴 **Critical Issues Found**

### 1. **Language Inconsistency**
- TypeScript agents: **English**
- Python Mentor Agent: **German**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent user experience
- **Fix**: Decide on one language or support multilingual properly

### 2. **No Prompt Centralization**
- Prompts are scattered across 7 different files
- **Problem**: Hard to maintain, test, and version
- **Recommendation**: Create `src/prompts/` directory with all prompts

### 3. **JSON Response Format Inconsistent**
- Some prompts specify JSON format, others don't
- **Problem**: Parsing errors and fallback logic needed
- **Fix**: Standardize all prompts to return structured JSON

### 4. **No Validation Instructions**
- Prompts don't include data validation requirements
- **Problem**: AI might return invalid data
- **Fix**: Add explicit validation criteria to prompts

### 5. **Limited Error Handling Instructions**
- Prompts don't specify what to do with incomplete data
- **Problem**: Generic fallback responses
- **Fix**: Add "If data is insufficient, respond with..."

---

## 🟡 **Improvement Opportunities**

### **Prompt Quality**

1. **Add Examples**: Include 1-2 example responses in each prompt
2. **Be More Specific**: Define exact JSON schema with field types
3. **Persona Consistency**: Each agent needs stronger personality definition
4. **Context Awareness**: Better use of learnings/hurdles in prompts

### **Structural Issues**

1. **No A/B Testing**: Can't test different prompt variations
2. **No Version Control**: Prompts aren't versioned
3. **No Metrics**: No way to track prompt effectiveness
4. **Hardcoded**: Can't update prompts without code changes

### **Missing Features**

1. **No Few-Shot Examples**: Prompts lack learning examples
2. **No Chain-of-Thought**: Complex analysis needs step-by-step reasoning
3. **No Self-Reflection**: Agents don't verify their own outputs
4. **No Confidence Calibration**: Confidence scores are arbitrary

## 💡 **Specific Prompt Improvements**

### **Identity Agent - Prompt 1**
**Current Issue**: Too generic, no personality type definitions

**Improved Version**:
```typescript
const prompt = `
You are an expert personality psychologist specializing in identity-based habit formation.

TASK: Analyze habit-identity alignment using James Clear's identity-based habits framework.

USER PROFILE:
- Personality Type: ${userProfile.personalityType || 'Not specified'}
  (If MBTI: I=introspective, E=social, S=practical, N=conceptual, T=logical, F=emotional, J=structured, P=flexible)
- Core Values: ${userProfile.coreValues?.join(', ') || 'Not specified'}
- Life Vision: ${userProfile.lifeVision || 'Not specified'}
- Main Goals: ${userProfile.mainGoals?.join(', ') || 'Not specified'}
- Life Phase: ${userProfile.lifePhase || 'Not specified'}
- Desired Identity: ${userProfile.desiredIdentity || 'Not specified'}

CURRENT HABITS:
${userContext.current_habits.map(habit => `- ${habit.name}: ${habit.why}`).join('\n')}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Personality-Habit Alignment (1-10): How well do habits match personality traits?
2. Identity Evolution Stage: "Exploring", "Developing", "Establishing", "Mastered"
3. Value-Habit Alignment: Which habits align/misalign with core values?
4. Identity Gap Analysis: What's missing to reach desired identity?
5. Habit Recommendations: 3-5 specific habits that bridge the identity gap

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON):
{
  "personalityScore": 7,
  "habitAlignmentScore": 6,
  "identityEvolutionStage": "Developing",
  "recommendedHabits": [
    {
      "habit": "Morning journaling",
      "alignsWith": "Core value: Self-reflection",
      "identityLink": "Reinforces 'I am a mindful person'",
      "difficulty": "low"
    }
  ],
  "identityInsights": "Your habits show strong alignment with...",
  "gapAnalysis": "To reach your desired identity of..., consider..."
}

VALIDATION:
- personalityScore must be 1-10
- habitAlignmentScore must be 1-10
- identityEvolutionStage must be one of: Exploring, Developing, Establishing, Mastered
- recommendedHabits must have 3-5 items
- Each recommended habit must include: habit, alignsWith, identityLink, difficulty

If insufficient data exists, set confidence scores to 3-5 and note in identityInsights.
`;
```

**Why Better**: 
- ✅ Clear framework reference (James Clear)
- ✅ Explicit personality type definitions
- ✅ Structured JSON schema with examples
- ✅ Validation requirements
- ✅ Handles insufficient data
- ✅ More actionable output format

### **Accountability Agent - Prompt 2**
**Current Issue**: Too generic, no tone guidance

**Improved Version**:
```typescript
const prompt = `
You are an empathetic accountability coach using evidence-based motivation psychology.

CONTEXT:
User: ${userContext.user.name}
Intervention Type: ${intervention.type} (check_in | intervention | celebration | reminder)
Urgency: ${intervention.urgency}
Focus: ${intervention.focus}
Current Habits: ${userContext.current_habits.map(h => h.name).join(', ')}

TONE GUIDELINES BY INTERVENTION TYPE:
- check_in: Curious, supportive, open-ended questions
- intervention: Empathetic, firm, solution-focused
- celebration: Enthusiastic, specific praise, momentum-building
- reminder: Gentle, non-judgmental, action-oriented

MESSAGE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Personalized (use their name and specific habit details)
2. Empathetic (acknowledge their situation)
3. Actionable (provide 1-2 specific next steps)
4. Motivating (reference their "why" or values)
5. Brief (max 150 words)

PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO APPLY:
- Loss aversion: Reference streak or progress at risk (for interventions)
- Social proof: Mention what works for others (when relevant)
- Implementation intentions: Suggest specific "when-then" plans
- Progress principle: Highlight small wins
- Growth mindset: Frame setbacks as learning opportunities

EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:

For "celebration":
"🎉 ${userContext.user.name}, amazing work! You've hit a 7-day streak on ${habit.name}! 
What's working so well? I noticed you've been consistent with morning sessions - that timing 
seems perfect for you. Keep riding this momentum! Tomorrow, try adding just 5 minutes more. 
You're becoming the ${identity} person you set out to be! 💪"

For "intervention":
"Hey ${userContext.user.name}, I noticed ${habit.name} has been challenging this week - 
only 2/7 completions. That's tough. Let's get you back on track. Your original 'why' was: 
'${habit.why}'. Is that still true? If yes, let's adjust the approach. What if we tried 
the minimal dose (${habit.minimalDose}) for 3 days? Small progress beats perfect plans. 
When do you want to try this? 🤝"

OUTPUT:
Return only the message text (no JSON), max 150 words, conversational tone.

If unclear about user's situation, ask: "How are you feeling about ${habit.name} this week?"
`;
```

**Why Better**:
- ✅ Clear psychological framework
- ✅ Tone guidance per intervention type
- ✅ Specific examples provided
- ✅ Word limit enforced
- ✅ Psychological principles referenced
- ✅ Handles ambiguity with question

### **Mentor Agent - Weekly Analysis**
**Current Issue**: No structure for analysis, vague output

**Improved Version**:
```typescript
const prompt = this.generateContextualPrompt(
  `You are an expert habit coach using the Atomic Habits framework for weekly performance analysis.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:
1. Identity Progress: Are they becoming who they want to be?
2. System Quality: Are their systems set up for success?
3. Obstacle Analysis: What's blocking progress?
4. Win Recognition: What should they celebrate?
5. Next Week Strategy: What should change?

USER'S WEEKLY DATA:
- Habits: ${userContext.current_habits.map(h => h.name).join(', ')}
- Completions: ${recentProofs.filter(p => p.completed).length}/${recentProofs.length}
- Completion Rate: ${userContext.weekly_summary?.completion_rate || 0}%
- Current Streak: ${userContext.weekly_summary?.current_streak || 0}
- Best Habit: ${bestHabit.name} (${bestHabit.rate}%)
- Struggling Habit: ${strugglingHabit.name} (${strugglingHabit.rate}%)

CONTEXTUAL BENCHMARKS:
- Week 1-2: 40-50% is normal (system building)
- Week 3-4: 60-70% target (habit forming)
- Week 5+: 75%+ goal (habit established)
- Elite: 85%+ (mastery level)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## 📊 Weekly Performance: [Above/At/Below] Target

### 🎯 Overall Assessment
[2-3 sentences on overall performance with specific numbers]

### ✅ What's Working
- [Specific win 1 with data]
- [Specific win 2 with data]
- [Pattern observation]

### 🚧 Challenges
- [Specific struggle 1 with data]
- [Root cause hypothesis]
- [Suggested adjustment]

### 💡 Key Insight
[1 powerful insight about their habit patterns this week - must be specific, not generic]

### 📋 Next Week Strategy
1. **Continue**: [What's working to maintain]
2. **Adjust**: [One specific change to test]
3. **Focus**: [One habit to prioritize]

### 🎯 Accountability Question
[One specific question to reflect on for next week]

TONE: Encouraging but honest, coach not cheerleader, data-driven not generic.

- Must reference specific habits and completion rates
- Must identify at least one working pattern
- Must suggest exactly ONE specific adjustment (not multiple)
- Insight must be non-obvious (not just "keep going!")
- Question must be reflective, not yes/no

If data is insufficient (< 3 proofs), focus on system design, not performance.
