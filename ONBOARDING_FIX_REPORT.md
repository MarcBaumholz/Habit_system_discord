# Onboarding Fix Report

- Fixed: defer reply in final modal submission to avoid Discord 'Unknown interaction'.
- Added: defensive errors in Notion createUserProfile for wrong DB ID (page vs database).
- Verified: NOTION_DATABASE_PERSONALITY in .env points to a Notion PAGE; needs DATABASE ID.
- Build: succeeded (tsc).

Next steps:
1) Replace NOTION_DATABASE_PERSONALITY in .env with the Personality Database ID (not a page ID).
2) Share that database with your Notion integration.
3) Restart bot and run /onboard again.
